The initial goal here is to make a simple install script that installs gentoo prefix on yur mac. 
It simply performs the steps as listed here on this great site. 
I may modify this to my liking but it is based off this:
 http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap-macos.xml
Dont be scared of the url, its a normal page.

This script will allow you to run a shell on a mac and pretend to be in gentoo. compile in native x86_64
